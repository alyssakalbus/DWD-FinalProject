# Dynamic Web Development x Bioart as Biopolitics Final Project

I was unable to get this to run on Glitch because the database would not authenticate.

## Original Project Proposal

**Research Questions, Criticisms, and Observations**
- What can the intentions and outcomes of military research reveal about future products and services?
- How does the illusion of user agency shape our interactions with technology?
- How does our understanding of history influence technology literacy?
- Can we separate the history of a technology from it’s current uses?
- People seem very willing to give up their data, genetic or otherwise, in exchange for a sense of belonging or security.
- How can humor or satire be used in a speculative work to entice critical reflection on our relationships to technology and data / genetic privacy or ownership?
- Why do people often feel a sense of ownership or perceive authority in intangible products?
- If biometric ownership, security, and encryption becomes a luxury service, what happens to those who can’t afford to encrypt themselves?
- What does it mean for DNA to be “secure,” and who is defining the metrics of security?

In a near future where DNA is treated as just another dataset, people’s genetic data is treated similarly to your online activity. Insurance and marketing companies are able to predict everything about you based on your genetic predispositions, and doctor’s office’s are constantly hacked to obtain new, updated datasets, and are often shared with state surveillance agencies. The wellness-centered service that frames bio-encryption as the next stage of “wellness” and “mindfulness,” offering genetic editing therapies to confuse and throw off algorithms. My process will be a mix of writing, worldbuilding, and a final web development project. The website will be a critical look into a potential future regarding the increasing practice of highly invasive biometric surveillance practices and genetic ownership.
